# Approved public build handoff

`handoff/` is a narrow bridge from the private V6 business-assets source to the public build. It is not a backup or mirror.

Use the files in this directory only after the matching facts or decisions are approved:

1. Confirm public-ready facts and resolve conflicts.
2. If an old website exists, record every known working public URL and its same-purpose replacement or exact approved redirect in `LEGACY_URL_PLAN.json`.
3. Record the homepage concept decision in `DESIGN_LOCK.json`. This is a look-and-feel approval, not approval to publish.
4. Populate `APPROVED_BUILD_BRIEF.md` and `PUBLIC_BUSINESS_FACTS.json` with the minimum public information needed for the build.
5. Build all remaining pages only after the homepage concept is approved.
6. Validate the full website before a hosted preview and again before go-live.

The Website Publishing System is not a design source. The approved homepage concept and business evidence control the custom site. A temporary preview may be used for owner review, but GitHub `main` and Cloudflare Pages are the final source and host.

Never place originals, raw captures, private records, interview notes, credentials, customer data, or the full business-assets source here. Phone owners do not edit these files; their approved one-ZIP package already contains only the public website.
